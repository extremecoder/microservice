- [ ] Job metadata storage (backend info, timestamps, etc.)
- [ ] Unit tests for job management functionality
- [ ] Test coverage >= 80%

### Task 4: Implement Simulator Adapters
**Description:** Create adapter modules for executing circuits on different simulator backends.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

### Task 6: Implement Advanced Features
**Description:** Add additional features to enhance the API functionality.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Parameterized circuit support
- [ ] Unit and integration tests for new features
- [ ] Test coverage >= 80%

### Task 7: API Documentation and Examples
**Description:** Create comprehensive API documentation and example usage.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] OpenAPI/Swagger documentation complete
- [ ] Example requests and responses documented
- [ ] Error code reference
- [ ] Example client code for Python
- [ ] README with clear usage instructions
- [ ] Environment variables documentation

## Sprint 3: Frontend Integration (2025-07-30)

### Task 8: Configure Frontend Routing
**Description:** Configure Kubernetes Ingress to route traffic to the existing frontend application and the backend API. Update API Gateway if necessary (Done - explicit routes added). Ensure backend service exists.
**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Backend Kubernetes Service (`quantum-microservice-service:8889`) exists and targets the correct deployment pods.
- [ ] Kubernetes Ingress resource created/updated in `k8s/ingress.yaml`.
- [ ] Ingress rule routes `/api/*` traffic to `quantum-microservice-service:8889`.
- [ ] Ingress rule routes `/*` traffic to `frontend-app-service:80`.
- [ ] Ingress uses `ingressClassName: alb`.
- [ ] Traffic is correctly routed via the API Gateway URL.
